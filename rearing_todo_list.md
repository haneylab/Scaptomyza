# Scaptomyza husbandry

This document describe a protocol to raise *Scaptomyza flava* on mustard greens which focuses on minimal effort, high density, and consistency. It is organised in three parts: Mustard production, insect rearing, and a practical weekly "todo list".

## Mustard plants

The aim of this part is to produce feeding material to Scaptomyza females and larvae. Insect perform best on 3 weeks-old plants.

### Plant cultivar

The red giant variety (MU $TODO$, WestCoast seeds) is used in virtue of its short development time, large leaves and slowness to bolt.

### Growing conditions

Plants are grown at 25C, on a 12:12 (L:D) light cycle at a final density of 400/m^2 (i.e. 36/flat). Standard fluorescent bulbs are used to produce a light intensity of $TODO$. Plants are grown on a 70% vermicompost + 30% vermiculite soil. 
Trays are watered and fertilised every week: 100mL of 10x fertiliser $todo:define solution$ is added to the water.
Square, 30cm x 30cm x 4cm flats, divided in 4 inserts, are used since they fit inside a 12in cubical insect cage, which facilitate handling.

## Insects

The aim of this part is to produce a large number of insects, in consistent conditions, every week. Insects take about three weeks to develop from egg to adults.

### Husbandry

30 (i.e. around 15 females), 1-7 days old adults, are added into a 12" cage with one tray of 3 weeks-old mustard (see above) and a solution of 10% sucrose + water (dispensed with a wick). After one week, all adults are discarded.

Larvae are left to develop until emergence and plants are watered once a week. As soon as they emerge, and for the two following weeks, adults are collected with an aspirator weekly and stored in a plastic milk bottle with a 5% sucrose + 2% agar medium (in water).


### Growing conditions

Same as above (light, temperature,...)


## Weekly todolist


### Weekly

1. Plant one tray of mustard seeds (aim fora final density of 36/tray), label the tray with the date (we will call it week 0 or w0)

2. Thin last week's tray (w1)

3. Add 1L of fertilised to all plants (w0-w3)

4. Water all plants, including ones with insects (w1-w7) (don't overwater)

5. Capture all emerged insects (w5-7), store them in milk bottles (1/cage/week), label the bottles

6. Put w3 (3week old mustard) in a cage with a falcon tube of sucrose+water, add 30 1-7days old flies.

7. Sanitize the last tray (w8): freeze the whole thing (including the folded cage), in a bag.

8. Discard the tray that was frozen last week (the soil can be composted, the plastic inserts go to garbage, and the cage as well as the tray can be cleaned kept for future cleaning/reusing)


### Once in a while


In order to save time, one can pre-make consumables and solutions depending on available space/time:


* Clean cages and trays: soak in 5% bleach for 1 h and rinse

* Prepare falcon tubes with sucrose + water, store in the freezer (forever)

* Prepare milk bottle with agar+sucrose+water, store at 4C, in a tight container (for < 2 months)

* Prepare fertiliser (x10) aliquots, store in the dark, at room temperature (for < 3 months)

* Premix and prepot soil

* Check/empty the insect "morgue" (an 70% ethanol + glycerol (1%)+ water container)
